\section{Concept generation and preliminary design}
\subsection{Concept generation}
	With all the premise that lead the development of the project, the first thing that has to be done is generate the concept that can later be compared to choose the best design solution that can become a concrete realization of the ideas.
	
	\paragraph{Kinematic configurations} The first key operation that the robot has to perform is reaching a desired point on the working space and so, in planar kinematics, the machine should present two degrees of freedom that allow to reach all the possible positions; this can be done considering 3 main joint configuration that allows to perform such operations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item double prismatic joints (figure \ref{fig:kinematiccoupling}.a) where two perpendicular linear guides can be used to move on the plane;
		\item prismatic and revolute joint (figure \ref{fig:kinematiccoupling}.b) where the arm that's free to rotate it's mounted on top of a linear guide. This kind of kinematic chain is currently used by the MindsHub prototype;
		\item double revolute joints (figure \ref{fig:kinematiccoupling}.c), typical configuration of a robot arm, that constraint the framing point to be fixed.
	\end{itemize}

	\end{figure}
	
	By a first analysis the third configuration (double revolute joint) isn't feasible for the project due to the fact that the system presents a fixed pivot point respect to the frame and to work more area it's mandatory to increase the length of the edges (and this is an issue for the \textit{extendibility} of the machine).
